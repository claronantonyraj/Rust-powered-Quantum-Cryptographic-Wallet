Quantum Crypto Wallet 

A Rust-powered, quantum-resistant cryptocurrency wallet  with a React.js frontend and  PostgreSQL storage.  
It simulates secure wallet creation using post-quantum encryption, generates public/private key pairs, and demonstrates low-latency transaction signing.

 Features
- Rust backend with secure key generation
- AES-GCM encrypted private keys (demo for post-quantum encryption)
- React.js frontend to create and view wallets
- Optional PostgreSQL integration for storing wallet keys
- Low-latency transaction signing simulation
- Serverless-ready architecture (can be deployed on AWS Lambda)

Tech Stack
- Backend: Rust, Warp, Tokio, AES-GCM
- Frontend: React.js, Axios, CSS
- Database : PostgreSQL
- Deployment-ready:AWS Lambda compatible
